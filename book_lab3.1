1. What are this malware’s imports and strings?
Using pestudio and PEbear I found that:
- In the strings there is a URL (www.practicalmalwareanalysis.com), and the string "CONNECT %s:%i HTTP/1.0".
- One of the strings looks like a registry entry used by malware to achieve persistance upon reboot (SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run) and there is another (advapi32), which indicares that the malware can try to use registry.
- Another registry entry: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Componnents\
- Software\Classes\http\shell\open\commandV → looks like opening a shell to execute a command
- kernel32.dll → lets malware access and manipulate memory, files and hardware
- admin
- user32
- advpack
- VideoDriver
- vmx32to64.exe (labelled as "file")
- AppData

Imports:
The only import is: ExitProcess - kernel32.dll, which might mean that the malware is packed.

2. What are the malware’s host-based indicators?
- user32
- admin
- registry entries
- Windows .dlls

3. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware? If so, what are they?
I established connection between my Windows VM and my Remnux VM, running inetsim on Linux, run procmon and Process Explorer, took the shot with regshot and run the malware.

When I run the malware, only a new processes called WerFault.exe were started for a while and then closed. Inetsim logs don't show anything. 
The only procees succeded: wmiprvse.exe (operatiom: thread exit). This is a process that allows a program to obtain information about the OS and performance.

The comparison in regshot shows that there were 133 changes in the registry: 2 deleted keys regarding ApplicationViewManagement; 8 aded keys: Group Policy Srvice Instances, ApplicationViewManagement and Shell; in added values there appera some Asian characters and Windows Cloud Store Cache

I am unable for now to force the malware to make a network connection.
