# Malware_Analysis

Excercices on my learning journey to master malware analysis. The source of every file that I analyse is stated in the analysis outcome. 
These are are solutions to the labs from the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig. Some exercises are part of "Malware Mondays" by The Cyber Yeti (https://www.thecyberyeti.com/malware-mondays).
