# Malware_Analysis

Excercices on my learning journey to master malware analysis. The source of every file that I analyse is stated in the analysis outcome. 
Some exercises are part of "Malware Mondays" by The Cyber Yeti (https://www.thecyberyeti.com/malware-mondays), others are solutions to the labs from the book "Practical Malware Analysis" by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.
