1. How can you get this malware to install itself?
It is a dll, so I converted it to an exe file with "dll_to_exe" tool. In the exports there is "ServiceMain", which suggests the malware needs to be installed as a service to run.
	

2. How would you get this malware to run after installation?
I was unable to run the malware in the VM, I suppose it's because, among others, it was designed for a different OS (Window XP) from the one I have in my VM (Windows 10). 
But to get the malware run we can use the command: net start <malware_process_name>.
	

3. How can you find the process under which this malware is running?
Using e.g., procmon, Process Explorer and/or Process Hacker. 
	

4. Which filters could you set in order to use procmon to glean information?
I would include filters related to process name, as we know that it creates a process IPRIP, and also the process with the name of the dll. I could also filter by PID.
	

5. What are the malwareâ€™s host-based indicators?
It installs a service IPRIP. If the malware installs itself, there will be a key added in the registry (compare information obtained from two shots in regshot).
	

6. Are there any useful network-based signatures for this malware?
It imports Windows Socket Library (WS2_32.DLL), which is a networking dll. In the strings I can see the URL (practicalmalwareanalysis.com). I can also see "GET" in the strings, which can be related to a GET request.
