This lab uses the files Lab01-01.exe (A) and Lab01-01.dll (B).
The tools: pestudio, PEbear

1. Upload the files to http://www.VirusTotal.com/ and view the reports. Does either file match any existing antivirus signatures?

2. When were these files compiled?
A ⇒ in File Header ⇒ Sunday 19.12.2010 16:16:19 UTC 
B ⇒ in File Header ⇒ Sunday 19.12.2010 16:16:38 UTC 
  
3. Are there any indications that either of these files is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? 
No, In Section Headers ⇒ some raw sections are significantly smaller in the virtual size.

4.  Do any imports hint at what this malware does? If so, which imports are they?
A ⇒ in imports looks for files (FindNextFile, FindFirstFile)
B ⇒ in imports (from WS2_32.dll) there are: inetaddr, socket, connect, send, recv, closesocket ⇒ signs of establishing an internet connection

5. Are there any other files or host-based indicators that you could look for on infected systems?
A ⇒ PEstudio → check strings → there are two similar records: "C:\Windows\System32\Kernel32.dll" and "C:\windows\system32\kerne132.dll" (where "kerne1" is supposed to look line a "kernel")

6. What network-based indicators could be used to find this malware on infected machines?
B ⇒ in imports (from WS2_32.dll) there are: inetaddr, socket, connect, send, recv, closesocket ⇒ signs of establishing an internet connection
B ⇒ in strings there is an IP address: 127.26.152.13

7. What would you guess is the purpose of these files?
in A there is a malware disguised as a legitimate dll ("kerne132.dll"), and in B there is an attempt to access the Internet to particular IP (backdoor)
