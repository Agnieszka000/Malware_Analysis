Analyze the malware found in the file Lab03-04.exe using basic dynamic analysis tools. (This program is analyzed further in the Chapter 9 labs.) 

1. What happens when you run this file?
When I run the file, the malware deleted itself.

Dynamic Analysis:
When the file is run, it delets itself.
In procmon I see that there is ProcessCreate.
The malware runs a command to delete itself.
/c - the argument that tells cmd.exe to run the following command
del Z:\Lab03-04.exe  - the command to delete the file Lab03-04.exe
>> NUL - redirects any output  from the commandline to a special device file NUL that discards data written to it. It is used to supress output and/or error messages.


2. What is causing the roadblock in dynamic analysis?
Lack of components?
